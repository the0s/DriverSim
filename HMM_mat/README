Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Toolbox written by Kevin Murphy (1998).
See http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~murphyk/Bayes/hmm.html for details.

If you installed this in directory matlab/HMM, in Matlab type
> addpath matlab/HMM
> addpath matlab/HMM/Demos

The following demonstration files are included:
- learn_dhmm_demo illustrates how to learn an HMM with discrete observations
- learn_mhmm_demo illustrates how to learn an HMM with a mixture of Gaussians observations
- fixed_lag_demo  illustrates how to do fixed lag smoothing
- online_em_demo  illustrates how to combine fixed-lag smoothing and EM

There are also some structure learning experiments using entropic
estimation. However, they rely on the function entropic_map written by
Matt Brand, which is not included. (addpath matlab/Entropic)
